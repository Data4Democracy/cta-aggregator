  :title: Demand Senators Take a Position on Trumpcare
  :description: "We're trying out a new feature at 5 Calls, and we can't think of
    a more important issue to test it out on than Trumpcare. \n\n[Sorry mobile users!
    The tracker is only available for the web interface at this time. Please go to
    5calls.org to report your call result]\n\nSenate Republicans have been working
    in secret to draft their new version of the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the
    Affordable Care Act repeal plan passed by House Republicans in May. A draft version
    of the bill, which was released on Thursday, June 22nd, contains provisions to
    wind down Medicaid expansion, further curtail Medicaid funding by establishing
    per capita federal funding limits, and allow states to exempt insurers from covering
    essential health benefits like maternity care. \n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional
    Budget Office analysis of the bill is out, and its findings are devastating. The
    bill would leave 22 million additional people uninsured by 2026, cut Medicaid
    funding by over a quarter by 2025, and increase healthcare spending by driving
    up higher deductibles and reducing covered benefits, all while delivering tax
    cuts to insurance executives and wealthy Americans. \n\nHelp us track who is voting
    for or against this unacceptable bill by calling your senator, asking if they
    support the AHCA, and *reporting their stance using the buttons below the script
    \nSUPPORTS, OPPOSES, or UNDECIDED*. \n\nWe'll be updating the tracker in real-time
    as the vote changes based on your responses, so keep calling to find out your
    Senator's latest position, especially if your Senator is an undecided or swing
    vote."

  :title: Reject the Cruz/Lee Amendment to Trumpcare
  :description: "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed what
    the vast majority of Americans already knew: The Senate's Affordable Care Act
    (ACA) repeal bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), is a cruel, ill-crafted
    disaster. The CBO's analysis predicts that BCRA will leave 22 million additional
    people uninsured by 2026, largely by slashing Medicaid funding by over a quarter
    by that date (and by 36% by 2036). \n\nWhile Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
    delayed a June vote on the BCRA because of overwhelming opposition to the bill,
    Republicans have failed to address the bill's disastrous impact on health insurance
    access. In fact, a new amendment to the bill, proposed by Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX)
    and Mike Lee (R-UT) would make the bill even worse for consumers with preexisting
    conditions buying plans on the individual market. The so-called Cruz Amendment
    would allow insurers to offer individual market plans that don't meet ACA standards
    as long as they also offer at least one ACA-compliant plan. This plan will functionally
    create high-risk pools, with sicker consumers buying the ACA-compliant plans at
    exorbitant prices. Middle-class consumers, who would not qualify for cost-sharing
    subsidies, would likely be unable to afford ACA-compliant plans. Cruz and Lee's
    amendment only adds to the overwhelming evidence that Republicans' true focus
    in the healthcare debate is achieving tax cuts for the wealthy, not maximizing
    healthcare access for all Americans. "

    millions of people to lose their insurance while doing nothing to resolve the
    Affordable Care Act's shortcomings, and the Cruz amendment only worsens the insurance
    market for those with pre-existing conditions. I hope the Senator will do the
    right thing and reject this bill. \n\nThank you for all your hard work answering

  :title: Demand the FCC Maintains Net Neutrality
  :description: |-
    Internet users scored a significant victory in 2014 when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) installed protections for net neutrality and the "open Internet." Net neutrality allows all users to have equal access to everything available on the Internet, and prevents Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from essentially turning the internet into cable television -- creating fast and slow speeds for sites of their choosing and charging consumers premium prices for upgraded access. Without net neutrality, small businesses, low-income individuals, and much of rural America would lose access to affordable, reasonably-fast internet service.

    The four major ISPs (Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, and AT&T) have been lobbying against the 2014 net neutrality regulations frustrated by the constraints placed on their ability to profit from those who need their services the most. They have specifically targeted the classification of ISPs as Title II services, a category that requires more strict federal oversight. In response to their lobbying efforts, the new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has pledged to roll back these net neutrality protections with a softer Title I classification and will allow ISPs to instead make voluntary, unenforceable commitments that they will maintain the open Internet. These ISPs need to know that net neutrality is not up for debate and the open Internet must be preserved.
  :template: "Hi, my name is [NAME] and I'm a concerned customer from [CITY, ZIP].
    \n\nI'm calling to express my disapproval that the FCC is trying to kill net neutrality
    and the strong Title II oversight of Internet Service Providers. Preserving an

  :title: 'Revoke Jared Kushner''s Security Clearance '
  :description: "As a senior advisor the President, Kushner is required to report
    (via SF86 security clearance forms) any meetings he's had with foreign government
    officials within the past 7 years. So far, he has withheld information about at
    least the following encounters: \n\n\n* a meeting with Russian Ambassador Kislyak
    to set up a communication backchannel\n* another with the head of Russia's VEB
    bank Sergey Gorkov\n* and now the June 9th meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia
    Veselnitskaya, Donald Trump, Jr. and Paul Manafort. \n\nKushner's omission of
    these meetings from his disclosure forms raises serious concerns about his national
    security clearance and the fact that he has access to top secret government information
    in the White House. Despite Kushner's confirmed knowledge of the Russian government's
    effort to help the Trump campaign on June 9th, 2016, and while Special Prosecutor
    Mueller investigates Kushner's financial ties to Russia and other foreign governments,
    Kushner continues to hold the highest level of security clearance and influence
    over public policy. In this context, reports from media sources that Kushner's
    recommended a hard line against Qatar means possible retribution for a failed
    personal real estate deal are alarming. \n\nBecause of his repeated failures to
    disclose suspicious information to government officials, Kushner's presence in
    the White House continues to pose a threat to our national security and his high
    level security clearance must be revoked."

  :title: Protect Funding for the Election Assistance Commission - Vote Thurs
  :description: "Despite the threat of Russian interference in more of our elections,
    the House is now moving to defund the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the
    federal agency that is meant to serve as a critical point of defense against any
    future election system hacking. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial
    Services voted to pass the FY 2018 Financial Services spending bill which includes
    a provision to remove the $4 million budget of the EAC. \n\nThe EAC was Created
    after the chaotic presidential election of 2000 as part of the Help America Vote
    Act and secures our voting process and infrastructure, providing support that
    local election officials rely on. In 2014, the commission was tasked with modernizing
    our severely outdated voting machines with more efficient, secure technology,
    and is working toward this goal. Terminating the EAC now will abruptly halt this
    process, putting our democratic process at a higher risk for voting irregularities,
    machine failures, and hacks. Pairing the demise of the EAC with the installment
    of Trump's voter fraud Commission led by VP Pence and voting rights attacker Kris
    Kobach sets the nation up for even more election problems and voter disenfranchisement.\n\nRep.
    Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) has already introduced an amendment to fund the EAC with

  :title: Demand Trump, Jr. Testify About His Dealings with Russians
  :description: "It is now clear that Donald Trump, Jr., Trump's campaign manager
    Paul Manafort, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner agreed to meet with a Russian
    government attorney with the explicit purpose of discussing information that the
    Russian goverment thought would help the Trump campaign. On June 9, 2016, they
    met with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer with long standing ties to the
    Kremlin. \n\nPrior to the meeting, Trump, Jr. received an email (the text of which
    he has now released) that stated that \"the Crown prosecutor of Russia\" had \"offered
    to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that
    would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful
    to your [Trump, Jr.'s] father.\" Trump, Jr. expressed interest in meeting to discuss
    this information immediately, writing, \"[I]f it's what you say I love it especially
    later in the summer.\" Follow-up emails made it clear that the meeting would be
    with a \"Russian government attorney\" and cc'ed Manafort and Kushner, meaning
    all three men were aware that they were meeting with a Russian government lawyer
    to try to hurt Clinton's campaign. These emails were sent right before the Wikileaks
    dump publicly revealed Russia's potential meddling. Also of note: two weeks after
    this meeting took place, Trump, Jr. went on CNN to deny claims of Russians helping
    the Trump campaign as \"disgusting\" and \"phony\" and has been making similar
    claims about the Russian election interference ever since.\n\nThe New York Times
    calls this incident \"the first public indication that at least some in the campaign
    were willing to accept Russian help.\" Trump, Jr.'s willingness to accept campaign-related
    information from a hostile foreign source, as well as the presence of top campaign
    officials Kushner and Manafort at the meeting are clear evidence of collusion
    between Russia and the Trump campaign. Neither Trump, Jr. nor Kushner disclosed
    the details of this meeting--in fact, the meeting was unearthed only after Kushner
    quietly revised a security form to note that it had happened. Their secrecy raises
    the question of how many more similar meetings took place unbeknownst to investigators,
    national security officials, and the public. \n\nAs Trump, Jr.'s emails have now
    revealed, Trump, Jr. deliberately sought out information obtained by a foreign
    government to interfere with the United States presidential election, an act of
    possible treason. Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort must publicly
    testify under oath about the details of this meeting and any other similar meetings
    they had with Russian nationals."

  :title: Keep Religious Organizations Out of Politics - Vote Thurs
  :description: "Update (7/10): The House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to
    vote on the 2018 Financial Services spending bill on Thursday, July 13th.\n\nOn
    June 29th, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General
    Government passed a FY 2018 spending bill that includes a provision to bar the
    Internal Revenue Service from enforcing the Johnson Amendment. The 1954 law currently
    prohibits tax-exempt houses of worship from endorsing political candidates or
    making campaign contributions. \n\nCurrently, the IRS revokes the tax-exempt status
    of any church or religious institution that endorses or funds a political candidate.
    If the IRS were to stop enforcing this rule, individuals and big donors could
    skirt campaign finance laws by funneling tax-free donations to candidates by way
    of churches (currently, no political campaign contributions are tax-exempt). The
    change would allow religious institutions to become major money players in our
    government by serving as channels for dark money donations to political campaigns.
    It is clear that the Subcommittee's rule change is specifically designed with
    right-wing evangelical groups in mind, as the proposed rule only mentions exempting
    churches and not other places of worship (mosques, synagogues, etc.). \n\nThe
    House's attack on the Johnson Amendment parallels the \"Religious Liberty\" executive
    order Trump signed in May. While a President cannot repeal or change laws such
    as the Johnson Amendment, Congress can, and is now doing so through the 2018 federal
    budget. The Financial Services spending bill that contains this provision now
    moves to the full House Appropriations Committee for further debate."

  :title: Block Lifetime Appointment of John K Bush to US Court of Appeals  - Vote
    Thurs
  :description: |-
    Update (7/10): The  Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Thursday, July 13 to advance John K. Bush for a full Senate vote.

    On Wednesday, June 14th, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the nomination of John K. Bush for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The Civil and Human Rights Coalition urges the Senate to reject Bush, as "John K. Bush is unworthy of a lifetime appointment as a federal judge. His extreme ideology and record show a hostility to women and LGBT people, campaign finance reform, and Democrats. Federal judges should be able to rule with impartiality and fairness, which are two qualities it's clear Bush lacks. We urge the Senate to reject this nominee."

    John K. Bush has zero experience as a judge. He is a commercial litigator and the president of a chapter of The Federalist Society, a group of conservatives and libertarians that promotes “originalism” - the view that the words of the Constitution should be interpreted as intended or understood by the authors. This interpretation results in deeply conservative interpretations of a broad range of issues. For example, from this perspective, Bush criticizes a Supreme Court ruling (NYT vs Sullivan) that protects freedom of the press from libel accusations. This willingness to suppress and punish freedom of the press is especially alarming in the context of Trump’s statement last year: “I’m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.”

    In addition to signaling a willingness to shield Trump from media scrutiny, Bush has made a number of deeply concerning statements and actions. He opposes public financing of political campaigns, the Affordable Care Act, and said abortion was one of the “two greatest tragedies in our country” (slavery being the other). He also wrote after the 2016 Republican National Convention that “the Democrats are trying to win with the same game plan as in 2008, only substitute woman for Black”.

    The Senate will ultimately decide on Bush’s appointment, and Senators needs to hear from their constituents about their opposition to this highly problematic candidate.
  :template: |-
    Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP]

    [IF COMMITTEE, ADD]: I'd like to leave a message for the Chairman and committee members.

    I’m calling today because I’m highly concerned about the appointment of John K. Bush to the US Court of Appeals. Bush has extreme ideology and I am concerned about the quality of his decisions. I ask that the Senator(s) vote against his appointment.

  :title: Preserve IRS Enforcement of the Insurance Mandate - Vote Thurs
  :description: "While Senate Republicans scramble to develop an Affordable Care Act
    (ACA) repeal bill, House Republicans are working in parallel to undermine the
    ACA through the federal budget appropriations process. The Republican-controlled

    bill that would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing the ACA's
    individual insurance mandate, which requires individuals to purchase insurance
    or pay a tax penalty that is either a set dollar amount or a percentage of their
    household income. \n\nThe ACA's insurance mandate is an essential element of the

    costs for sicker people and lowering premiums for everyone. In fact, the nonpartisan

    be enough to drive up premiums. Insurers have also used uncertainty about the
    mandate's enforcement to justify premium rate increases in 2018. Republicans must
    not be allowed to sabotage the ACA. The individual mandate is a critical component

  :title: Advocate for a Bipartisan Effort to Repair the ACA
  :description: |-
    The delayed vote on Senate GOP's new ACA-repeal bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), represents an opportunity for Republicans to abandon their partisan obsession with dismantling the ACA and instead partner with Democrats to shore up the law. One major Republican critique of the ACA has been that the individual insurance markets are unstable and have increasingly high premiums. However, all analyses of these markets have shown that the markets are stable overall and that consumers have largely been shielded from premium increases thanks to tax subsidies. In fact, most of the instability of the insurance markets have stemmed from insurance company uncertainty about whether Republicans will continue paying the cost-sharing reductions that allow them to insure sicker people at lower cost. Healthcare spending has also slowed under the ACA, and people have objectively benefitted from increased access to healthcare, especially preventive services.

    The Senate repeal bill actually maintains much of the ACA's structure while cruelly cutting things like premium subsidies and funding for Medicaid expansion. Instead of trying to adopt a worse version of the ACA, Republicans should work with Democrats to implement a package of ACA fixes, from insurance market stabilization to negotiation of lower pharmaceutical costs, that would preserve (and even increase) access to affordable health insurance while still containing healthcare spending. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has already called on Trump to meet with Democrats to find a bipartisan way forward. Now, it's on Republicans to do the right thing and shift their focus from repealing the ACA to fixing the ACA.

    Schiff, Trump's nominee to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, is infamous for his

    Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

    [IF COMMITTEE, ADD]: I'd like to leave a message for the Chairman and committee members.

    I'm calling to express my concern about Damien Schiff's nomination to the US Court of Federal Claims. Schiff has publicly espoused extremist views that are at odds with judicial precedent, and has consistently proved that he lacks the judgment and temperament to serve on a federal court. I ask that the Senator(s) vote against his nomination.

    Thank you for all your hard work answering the phones.

  :title: Protect America’s Rivers, Lakes and Wetlands
  :description: "In June, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposal
    to roll back the Waters of the United States Rule, a 2015 rule that expanded the
    bodies of water covered by federal environmental protection laws under the Clean
    Water Act. The rule extended the environmental protections already provided to
    large, navigable bodies of water to the smaller waters that flow into them, like
    rivers, streams, and wetlands.  The Obama-era rule was designed to clarify conflicting
    court rulings. Repealing the rule was a Trump campaign promise.\n\nEnding the
    Waters of the United States Rule removes Clean Water Act protections from water
    sources that supply drinking water to one in three Americans to provide regulatory
    breaks to big corporations.  As the Environmental Law and Policy Center noted,
    “Rollback of clean water standards rejects years of work building stakeholder
    input and scientific data support, and it imperils the progress for safe clean
    drinking water in the Midwest.” Supporters of the Waters of the United States
    Rule also worry that this is the first step in a broader attempt to gut the Clean
    Water Act as part of the Trump Administration’s pro-business, anti-environment
    agenda.\n\nAs we have too frequently seen, state and local jurisdictions do not
    always adequately protect and maintain water sources, and federal protection is
    needed to ensure that the water that families, communities, and businesses depend
    on remains clean and safe from pollution. "
  :template: "Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].  \n\nI’m
    calling to oppose the EPA's planned rollback of the Waters of the United States
    Rule. Ensuring clean water for all Americans is a national priority that requires
    federal support, and it is irresponsible to end a rule that protects 1 in 3 Americans'
    drinking water sources. I urge [SEN/REP NAME] to fight against the elimination
    of the Waters of the United States Rule.\n\nThank you for your work answering
