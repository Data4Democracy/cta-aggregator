    The Congressman's staff regularly hold office hours at rotating Sacramento Public Libraries (SPL) throught his district.

    This event is at the SPL - Sylvan Oaks Branch

    They specify they are there to "help Veterans with backlogged benefits, assist seniors with Social Security and Medicare, stalled passports and more."

    These office hours are always a great opportunity to meet staff and develop a dialogue with your Congressmans' staff. While they cannot always speak on positions, they can pass along concerns and share stories with the Congressman.

  description: "NIGHT OUT FOR SAFETY AND LIBERATION 2017---MEET YOUR NEIGHBORS AND
    WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD SAFER COMMUNITIES IN DC! \n\nTuesday- August 1, 2017 is
    the Night Out for Safety and Liberation (NOSL) in Washington D.C., and across
    the country. For those of us who believe that there is a better tomorrow, the
    NOSL serves as a space for us to come together as a community and discuss our
    visions, ideas and plans to get there. \n\nThe Movement for Black Lives DC hopes
    to foster this community dialogue Block-Party Style-- A night filled with vendors,
    music, food, child care, kids activities, art, workshops, healing services and
    much more!!\n\nThe purpose of NOSL is to redefine and reimagine what #SafetyIs
    for our communities. We hope to help cultivate a shared understanding of public
    safety beyond racially and class biased policing, prison, immigration and detention
    systems. We are instead asking people to come out and focus on proven solutions
    to safer communities, such as access to quality healthcare, education, housing,
    public transportation, and jobs. What do you think every safe community needs?
    \n \nLet’s not limit our view of safety as the policing of our neighborhoods.
    We must redefine, reimagine, and determine for ourselves what #SafetyIs. \n\nWe
    hope to see you on August 1! Hosted by the Movement for Black Lives DC (M4BL DC)
    #NOSL17DC #NOSL17\n\nLogistical Notes: We are hoping to provide rides for folks
    to and from Congress Heights metro on the night of the event. We are using group
    carpool to organize rides.\n\nPLEASE FOLLOW THIS LINK TO SIGN-UP TO PROVIDE A
    RIDE, OR IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE A RIDE TO THE EVENT ON TUESDAY: https://www.groupcarpool.com/t/i3o59e\n\nHere
    are the steps:\n1. IF YOU HAVE A CAR and are able to provide rides from Congress
    Heights metro please click \"ADD\" a carpool. The departing time should indicate
    when you will be departing from Congress Heights metro and the return time should
    indicate when you would be leaving the event.\n2. IF YOU NEED A RIDE please click

    full, (or there are no current carpools added) - you'll know because you won't

  description: "It's time to celebrate! We, the Resistance, helped to block the cruel
    Trump GOP healthcare bill that would have taken healthcare away from millions
    of people, icnluding half a million North Carolina citizens. So, let's celebrate
    and while we are celebrating let's also focus our attention on making our voices
    heard with our elected officials. \n\nWe've invited Representative Holding to
    come to Coats to meet with us and hear our concerns. His office has rejected our
    requests for a town hall--I even have the emails--so we're going to hold one without
    him.  Let's make our voices heard about healthcare, corruption, the environment,
    and the many other issues that concern us! \n\nWe've picked Coats for this event
    because it is close to the geographic center of NC2 and because we want to show
    that constituents in the redder sections of our district are also concerned about
    the issues and want their voices heard.\n\nThe town hall will be held on August
    2 at the Coats Chamber of Commerce, which is roughly in the geographic center
    of Holding's (heavily gerrymandered) district. It will kick off at 6 PM and will
    run until 8 PM.\n\nHere's how you can volunteer for our event:\nhttp://www.signupgenius.com/go/60b0c44abae29a31-august\n\nHere's

    to give participants the opportunity to build skills and knowledge to engage in
    conversations about oppression. Participants are expected to attend all three
    parts of this workshop. The first session will focus on the concept of white fragility,
    the struggle for dominant communities to tolerate discussions on race without
    feeling shame, guilt, or victimization. The second session dives into myths and
    stereotypes in order to identify subconscious bias and how these bias affect our
    daily lives. The final session offers tools and guidelines for action in order
    to reaffirm our commitment to creating and supporting an anti-oppressive society.
    \n\nRegistration is limited to 25 people, with a fee of $60 for the general public
    and $30 for current PJC members and volunteers. No one will be turned away for
    lack of funds. All PJC programming is offered at no cost to individuals under
    25. If you would like to learn more about membership visit: http://www.pjcvt.org/get-involved/become-a-member/

  description: "This special SURJ chapter meeting will focus on a specific way that
    we can take action in our community... Recently, a consortium of organizations
    have formed The Sonoma County Rapid Response Team in order to respond quickly
    to increasing threats to our immigrant community and other vulnerable popluations
    (see below). \n\nAt this SURJ meeting you will learn exactly how this team works
    -\n and you will be trained as a legal observer, able to respond as an ally during
    a critical situation. \n- - - - - - - - - - - \nThe Sonoma County Rapid Response
    Team\n- - - - - - - - - - - \nWe are working to create a way for people to respond
    to fear and anxiety in our community as a result of the increase in immigration
    enforcement, ICE raids and other attacks against our communities. Our network
    provides a way for people of goodwill to bear witness, accompany, and protect
    members of our community who are living through the increase in immigration enforcement
    and ICE raids. Legal observer teams are building across Sonoma County that will
    respond to calls regarding ICE raids made to a Sonoma County based hotline that
    will operate 24 hours a day.\n\nAccompaniment teams are also forming: Accompaniment
    is a long-term commitment to be present for the victims and involved in the work.
    These teams will work to support the victims with presence to their needs—rides,
    connecting to social services, food, making appointments, housing, etc. Also work
    to organize public actions to support their case, to connect them to the movement
    to tell the stories, as well as to go with them to court hearings and other proceedings."

  description: Let's do it again, this time we will be grilling at the Biloxi Back
    Bay pavilion in Hiller Park from 10:30 to 1 PM. We're looking for your input and
    ideas on how to move the party forward in Harrison County. The pavilion is large
    but seating is limited, it's recommended you bring your own chair. Bring a side
    dish if you wish. This is a free event.
